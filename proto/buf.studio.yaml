# Buf Studio Agent Configuration
# This file configures how Buf Studio connects to your services

agents:
  # Auth Service
  - name: datifyy-auth-service
    description: Datifyy Authentication Service
    # When gRPC is implemented, use this:
    address: localhost:9090
    # protocol: grpc
    # For now, the backend uses HTTP REST
    # You can still explore proto definitions in Buf Studio

  # User Service
  - name: datifyy-user-service
    description: Datifyy User Profile Service
    address: localhost:9090
    # protocol: grpc

# Alternative: Use Buf Studio web interface
# Visit: https://studio.buf.build
# And load your proto files from the local filesystem
