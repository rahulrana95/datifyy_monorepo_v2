Datifyy - PRD

Absolutely! Here's a well-structured Product Requirements Document (PRD) introduction section for the Datifyy Web App, written in the style of a senior Product Manager for a dating-tech startup with a high emphasis on UX, scalability, and consistency.

📝 Product Requirements Document (PRD)
📍 Project: Datifyy – Verified Dating Web Application
🗓️ Phase: Initial MVP + Admin Tooling + Responsive Frontend

🧭 Overview
Datifyy is a modern, responsive dating web platform built to provide verified, curated, and meaningful dating experiences for users. Unlike typical swipe-based dating apps, Datifyy emphasizes human-curated matchmaking, partner preference alignment, and real-time engagement through guided video and in-person date setups.
We focus on creating trust-based interactions where every user is verified, and every match is intentional.

🎯 Vision & Core Objectives
Enable users to discover and connect with curated matches based on deeply aligned partner preferences.


Build a robust admin interface to allow for match curation, feedback analysis, and communication workflows.


Maintain an engaging and consistent UX across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.


Uphold trust, safety, and verification as core pillars of the platform.


Ensure high-quality user data collection to power algorithmic and admin-led matchmaking.



📱 Platform UX Guidelines (Critical)
✅ Responsive by Default
All views must be fully responsive and tested across:


Mobile (iOS + Android breakpoints)


Tablets


Desktops (HD to widescreen)


Every component should scale fluidly and retain visual clarity and functionality.


✅ Unified Design System
Chakra UI as the component library with custom theming for Datifyy.


Consistent typography, spacing, form fields, modals, cards, and interaction feedback.


All admin and user views follow the same design language, ensuring familiarity and reduced cognitive load.


✅ Intuitive & Addictive Experience
Flow of filling user information (including profile & partner preferences) should feel effortless and rewarding.


Progressive disclosure, autosave, and guidance patterns encouraged.


Use micro-interactions and nudges to keep users engaged throughout setup.



🧑‍💻 User Journey – Key Screens & States
🔐 Authentication Flow
When a user visits datifyy.com, the header shows:


Login / Signup buttons (if not authenticated)


Current City/State detection (with dropdown to change)


Language Selector (multi-lingual support planned)


Responsive navbar behavior:


Collapsible on mobile, persistent on desktop


🏠 Landing Page
Communicates who we are, why Datifyy is different, and how the platform works.


Encourage new users to start building their profile or learn more about our verified speed dating and curated date formats.



🧍User Profile Setup
Step-by-step guided experience to collect key details:


Personal information (name, gender, DOB, etc.)


Identity verification (govt ID, workplace, email)


Preferences and lifestyle (diet, religion, education, habits)


Photos & bio


Emphasis on building trust, safety, and match quality through depth of profile.



💞 Partner Preferences Page
A dedicated experience where users submit detailed preferences for their ideal match.


For each field, users specify:


Their preference (e.g., education level, salary range)


Match strength:


Must Have


Nice to Have


Doesn’t Matter


This structured input powers matching algorithms and admin curation.


Smooth UX with:


Autocomplete fields


Step indicators


Conditional sections based on gender or orientation



🔁 Mutation UX & Error Handling
All mutation actions (e.g., form submit, delete, update) must:


Trigger a confirmation modal


Handle backend JSON error messages gracefully


Show user-friendly toasts or alerts (e.g., “Something went wrong. Please try again.”)


Optimistic UI updates where appropriate.



🧑‍💼 Admin Interface (Brief Preview)
Admins are central to the Datifyy experience.


They curate matches, manage sessions, trigger communication workflows, and ensure platform integrity.


Admin interface adheres to the same design system and UX quality.


Built with enterprise-grade controls (e.g., filters, bulk actions, data insights).



Let me know when you're ready to move into the next section of this PRD — for example:

Partner preference schema

 I'll continue building it with the same clarity and production-readiness.




Here’s a well-organized PRD section for the Availability Management feature, written in a professional product document style as part of the Datifyy platform:

📆 Availability Management – User Scheduling Module
🧩 Part of: Datifyy – Verified Dating Experience Platform

🎯 Objective
To enable users to submit, view, and manage their availability for dates over the upcoming 7 days, allowing admins to match and schedule curated dates efficiently. This ensures real-time matchmaking readiness, improves success rates, and facilitates structured, mutual interactions.

🔑 Core User Stories
1. ✅ Submit Availability
Users can select available date & time slots for the next 7 days.


Each slot includes:


📅 Day (e.g., Friday, Saturday, etc.)


🕒 Time Block:


Morning (8AM–12PM)


Afternoon (12PM–4PM)


Evening (4PM–8PM)


Night (8PM–11PM)


🧍 Mode: Online or Offline


If Offline:


Let users choose a venue type (e.g., Café, Park, Co-working lounge)


Future enhancement: allow them to select from curated partner venues


UX:


Show slot selection via interactive calendar view or time-grid


Disable slots already booked


Allow multi-slot selection in one go


Optimistic UI: visual confirmation before submission



2. ✏️ Edit or Cancel Availability
Users can view their submitted availability at any time


Display grouped by day, then time block


Tag for online/offline


Users can:


Edit slot mode (online/offline)


Delete slot


When cancelling an availability slot:


If a date is already scheduled in that slot:


❌ The date is auto-cancelled


📧 Trigger email + in-app notification for both users


Log admin-side audit of cancellation cause



3. 🔔 Reminders & Nudges
If a user has:


0 or ≤1 upcoming availability for next weekend, trigger:


📩 Email reminder every Wednesday morning (local time)


🔔 In-app notification when they next open the platform


Message copy: “Your weekend’s looking empty! Add availability to get matched.”


Part of an engagement automation engine to boost active participation.



4. 🚫 Slot Conflict Detection
While submitting availability:


Already booked slots (confirmed dates) are disabled and clearly marked.


Users cannot override those.


Avoid overbooking or double submissions.



5. 💻 Responsive Design & UX
Mobile-first with tablet + desktop support


Calendar grid must feel natural and tactile on mobile (tap to select)


Form submission always confirms with a modal


Backend returns JSON errors – frontend gracefully parses and displays meaningful errors



🛠️ Admin Impact
Availability data is consumed by the Admin Panel to:


Show upcoming available slots for match curation


Prevent conflicts with pre-booked dates


Understand user participation patterns



🔐 Privacy & Compliance
All availability data is tied to a verified user


Slot times are never exposed to other users


Cancellations are only processed via confirmed user actions
